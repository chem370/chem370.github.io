**Week 2: Characterizing Measurements**

This week will focus on learning the language of analytical chemistry and understanding the statistical tools a chemist routinely uses to describe their data.

**To Do:**

1. Watch all the 2.X.X videos and complete the end-of-video quizzes (found in MS Teams).
1. Watch [*The Normal Distribution and the 68-95-99.7 Rule*](https://youtu.be/mtbJbDwqWLE).
1. (Lab) Make sure you've completed exercises 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 in [Chapter 1 of the Lab Manual]({{site.url}}/chem370/lab-manual/getting-started-in-r.html) by Wednesday night.  (There's nothing to turn in this time!)
1. Attend your designated lecture and lab section.
1. Complete the Week 2 quiz by Sunday at midnight.

**Reading:**

- Harvey [Chapter 3](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_(Harvey)/03%3A__The_Vocabulary_of_Analytical_Chemistry) (Lecture 2.1)
- Harvey [Chapter 4](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_(Harvey)/04%3A_Evaluating_Analytical_Data) (Lecture 2.2)

**Coming Up:**

- Your first lab assignment will be due two weeks from Wednesday, 2020-09-09.
- We will cover Harvey Chapter 5 next week.

The video lectures are a little long this week.  I've done this to allow you time for data processing next week and because the lab this week is especially short.
