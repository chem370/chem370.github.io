**Week 3: UV-vis Fluorescence Spectroscopy**

We will conduct the UV-vis lab (Lab 2) this week.  It is our first week of in-person classes!

**What to know:**

- You will come to lab for an hour and half (only half of the 3-hour time window).  This is because only half of the class is allowed in the lab at a time.
- It is important that you have your calculations done and lab notebook setup before coming to lab if you want to finish in the allotted hour and a half!
- You will need to bring your computer to lab.

**To Do:**

1. Read the [intro](https://chem370.github.io/uv-vis/) and complete the [pre-lab](https://chem370.github.io/uv-vis/prelab) for the UV-vis lab (there is a pre-lab spreadsheet for you to turn in on Teams).
1. Complete the lab safety video and quiz ***before*** you come to lab.  Both of these count toward your lab-safety grade!
1. Attend your designated lab period. Please arrive on time, with goggle, gloves, and appropriate attire (long pants, closed-toe shoes, no tank tops).  You will also need a computer with [Vernier Spectral Analysis](https://www.vernier.com/product/spectral-analysis/) installed.

**Turn In:**

1. Turn in your GC-TCD notebook by Tuesday, February 16 at midnight (deadline: February 17).
1. Complete the lab safety video and quiz (nothing to turn in as long as you complete both).

**Coming Up:**

- Next week is the Lab 2 data processing week.  You have a total of 2 weeks to complete the data processing.
- You will need to watch the [instrument training videos](https://chem370.github.io/instrument-tutorials/) and take the quizzes before beginning the rotation labs in 2 weeks!
