         A is at m/z = 114.  This means the M.W. is 114.

    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">
   <span>
         (60/599)/1.1 * 100 = 9, suggesting 8 C (8.8 is expected for 8 C).

    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">

         A is even, so there is like 0 or 2 N atoms.  The IR shows no evidence of N, so likely there is 0.

    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">
   <span>
         The IR suggests only C and H, so let's start there.  A / A + 1 suggests 8 C.  C8H18 would work for a M.W. of 114. There are no rings or double bonds possible.

    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">
   <span>
         The peak at 29 is likely C2H5, suggesting a fragment of that sort in the molecule.  Loss of Loss of 43 (114 to 71) is likely C3H7, suggesting that fragment in the molecule.  This also shows up as a peak at mass 43.  There is little evidence for anything other than a straight-chain hydrocarbon. [Octane]

    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">
   <span>
         A logical choice would be 85.  This would suggest N in the molecule, e.g. C5H15N, and there is no evidence of this in the IR spectrum.  It also gives a non-integer number of rings and double bonds (meaning it's an odd-electon ion).  This means 85 cannot be the molecular ion!  84 or 86 would be logical second choices, but 84 will be easier to interpret.
         Let's assume A is at m/z = 84.  This means the M.W. is 84.

         There is little evidence for loss of anything other than hydrocarbons.  However, there must be 1 ring or double bond.  The relatively strong A peak often suggests a cyclic structure because fragmentation would require breaking 2 C-C bonds instead of one with a non-cyclic isomer. [cyclohexane]

   What functional groups might be present in this molecule?

    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">
   <span>
         The IR spectrum shows distinct evidence of a -COOH group with the very strong, broad peak around 3000 cm^-1.  There is also a C=O peak present around 1700 cm^-1, also suggesting COOH.  We should expect for evidence of O in the MS.

<div class="check-understanding">
   What is the A peak (molecular ion)?
   <label class="tooltip-understand" style = "top: 50%; left: 20px; font-size: 14px;">
    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">
   <span>
         We expect 2 O atoms from the IR, so we need should expect A, A+1, and A+2 peaks in the MS.  A good choice for A would therefore be 60.  For this, A+2/A is 20/7479 * 100 = 0.3, which is consistent with 1-2 O.

<div class="check-understanding">
   How many C atoms are there in this molecule?

    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">

         199/7479/1.1*100, or about 2, C atoms.

<div class="check-understanding">
   What does the nitrogen rule tell you about the molecule?
   <label class="tooltip-understand" style = "top: 50%; left: 20px; font-size: 14px;">
    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">
   <span>
         A is even, so there is like 0 or 2 N atoms.  The IR shows strong evidence of COOH, but the C=O peak can sometimes be confused the a N-H peak.  Still, we can probably rule out N based on IR.

<div class="check-understanding">
   Can you come up with a formula?
   <label class="tooltip-understand" style = "top: 50%; left: 20px; font-size: 14px;">
    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">
   <span>
         We have 2 C and 2 O; the rest will likely be H.  C2H4O2 is works as a formula, with 1 ring or double bond.

<div class="check-understanding">
   Can you find evidence of a particular structure from the formula you determined?
   <label class="tooltip-understand" style = "top: 50%; left: 20px; font-size: 14px;">
    ANSWER 
    <input type="checkbox">
   <span>
   A loss of 15 (60-45) suggests loss of CH3, indicating we likely have a CH3 in the molecule; the corresponding fragment ion at 15 supports this.  The peak at 45 is most like CH3C=O, suggesting the CH3 is joined to a carbonyl.  At this point the only logical structure is H3C-C=O-OH [Acetic Acid]
