# Lab 0: Introduction to Julia & Pluto
{: .no_toc  }

----

## Summary

**Objective:** Become familiar with Markdown, Julia, and Pluto

**Turn in:** Your lab 1 prelab.

**Student Learning Outcomes**: 

By the end of this lab, students will:

  - Familiarize themselves with Markdown syntax.
  - Familiarize themselves with Pluto and Julia.
  - Understand how to access lab notebook templates in Pluto.

## Introduction

You will keep an electronic lab notebook this semester using the programming language Julia and a notebook extension for it called Pluto.  We’ll discuss more of the details about what Julia is and why we’re using it throughout the semester. For now, you just need to be able to get it running, learn the basics, and create a lab notebook template for the GC-TCD lab.  You'll probably find it's most convenient to install Julia on your personal computer (it's free!), although you can also use it on STEM VCAT if you choose not to install it on your computer or have trouble with your computer.  The exercises here will walk you through installation Julia and Pluto and then introduce you to some of their features.
