# Introduction

You'll use two tools to write your lab notebooks this semester: (1) the Julia programming language, which allows you to perform calculations, and (2) the Pluto notebook extension for Julia. Pluto is an add-on for Julia that makes it easy to combine text and code into an electronic notebook format.  

Put very simply, you will write code in the form of text commands and ask Julia to run the code. Once it‚Äôs finished running, Julia gives you the output (answers) you‚Äôve asked for. For example, to create an x-y scatter plot of 1, 2, 3 and 6, 5, 4 you would type `scatter([1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4])`, which produces the plot below.

In this tutorial you‚Äôll explore the Pluto notebook interface and learn Markdown.  Learning these tools will help you prepare for Lab 1, so it's essential you're beginning to understand them before you come to lab next.

# Understanding Pluto

Pluto notebooks are composed of *cells*, which are represented as tan boxes in the notebook.  

The rules for Pluto cells are:
- A cell can contain text *or* calculations (but not both)
- A cell can only contain one line of code

All text must be written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which you can think of as a very simple word processing utility.  All code must be written in the Julia language.

The methods of working with Pluto cells are:
- To add a new cell, click the plus (+) icon on the left top or bottom of an existing cell.
- To execute the code contained in a cell press the play button on the bottom right of the cell.
- To delete a cell press the x on the right side of the cell.
- To move a cell hover the mouse outside the left side of the cell and drag it to a new location.
- To hide or show the code in a cell click the grey eyeball in the top left corner.

To get practice with this, complete the following excerpt about cats from the Getting Started example notebook included with Pluto and written by Fons van der Plas & Nicholas Bochenski.

# Formatting Text with Markdown

You should have noticed that Pluto makes it possible to place formatted text between code cells.  This is done with Markdown, and you'll use this feature a lot in your notebooks.  Using it only requires you know a few basic rules. Complete the tutorial linked below to learn those rules.

# Conclusion

You'll use Pluto for your lab notebooks this semester, and this exercise covered the basics of the Pluto interface and how to format text using Markdown.  You'll use Markdown anytime you need to add text to your lab notebook.  In the next exercise you'll learn how to embed calculation and plots using Julia.

You will use all of this information many times over the course of the semester, beginning next week in lab.  Make sure you are beginning to understand it before moving on!
