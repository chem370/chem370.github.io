## Launch Julia & Open the Template

### Launch Julia

1. The way you launch Julia will depend on your operating system.  You will see a window like the image below, which is called the REPL (read-evaluate-print loop).

   - **Windows:** Search for Julia using Windows search.
   - **Mac OSX:** Look for Julia in your Applications folder or search for  Julia using Spotlight (`Cmd + Space` on Mac brings up Spotlight).
   
      <div class = "tip">If this is the first time you've run Julia on your Mac you may have to right click (or CTRL + click) on Julia in your Applications folder, choose Open, and give Julia permission to run on your machine.</div>
      
   - **Ubuntu Linux:** Open the terminal and type `julia`.

### Launch Pluto
   
1. Open Pluto by typing the following commands into the Julia prompt and then hitting the Enter key.

      ```julia
       import Pluto; Pluto.run()
      ```

1. Pluto should open in your default web browser (it requires Firefox, Chrome, or another Chromium-based browser to run properly).

      <div class = "tip">If Pluto doesn't open automatically or you would like to use a different browser other than your default copy and past the link from the Julia REPL into your browser URL bar.  The link will look like 'localhost:1234/?secret=...'.</div>
