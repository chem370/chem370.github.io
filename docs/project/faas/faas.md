## Introduction

Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy is a common method of determining the concentration of specific metals (cations) in a sample.  A solution is nebulized (aerosolized) into an acetylene flame where it is atomized (broken apart into its constituent atoms).  The atoms in the flame absorb characteristic wavelengths of light, unique to each element.  A light source specific to the analyte of interest (specifically, a hollow cathode lamp) shines through the flame, where the light gets absorbed by the sample.  The amount of light absorbed is linearly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in solution.  Although the instrument is relatively robust and inexpensive, it is limited to probing for a single analyte at a time.

The general procedure for this lab is to:

1. prepare standards, blanks, and QCs.
1. Vape a sample and collect the aerosol.
1. Run the standards, blank, and QC and check that they pass .
1. Run the samples.

For flame AA, the definitions of "passing" are:  

1. **Standard Curve:** A linear line with $R^2 \ge 0.9990$.  
1. **QC:** A measured concentration within 5% ($\pm$ 5%) of the known concentration.  

This is a quantitative analysis.

## Safety

- This experiment uses [5% nitric acid](https://www.identipack.com/sites/default/files/documents/SDS%20sheets/SDS%20EN%20Nitric%20Acid%205-10%20per%20cent%20%28HNO3%29.pdf).  Wear gloves and goggles!
- This experiment involves using an e-cigarette for an extended period of time.  The cigarette may get very hot over this time period; take care not to burn yourself.  
- Nicotine is toxic.  Wear gloves when working with the vape juice and handling the e-cigarette.  
- Do not breathe the e-liquid aerosol or let it into the room -- do the vaping step in a fume hood!  
- Never leave the flame AA unattended when the flame is on.  
- Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin.
