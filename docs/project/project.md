**Objective**

Read the Memorandum on the following page to understand the scenario for this lab and determine your objectives.

**To Turn In**

- Separate lab notebooks for each technique (e.g. one for HPLC, one for FT-IR, etc.) as ZIP folders containing your notebook and data.  Each student will submit a notebook individually roughly every three weeks.
- A technical report detailing the entire project, to be turned in in stages (one per group).
- Consult the [schedule]({{site.url}}/course-information/schedule) to keep track of due dates for notebooks and report stages.  
- Refer to the materials on the [writing page]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports) for templates, formatting guidelines, content expectations, and grading rubrics.
- An analysis worksheet for each instrument (linked under the Data Processing sections for each instrument).

**Student Learning Outcomes:**

By the end of this lab, students will:

- Utilize chemical instrumentation for qualitative analysis of complex samples (e.g. GC-MS, Flame AA to ID sample contents).
- Apply instrument calibration techniques to conduct quantitative analysis on complex samples (e.g. FT-IR, HPLC, and Flame AA).
- Assess data validity using quality control and blank samples.
- Utilize Julia to perform data analysis in an electronic lab notebook (including chemometric analysis).
- Participate effectively in group lab work and writing activities.
- Compile results from multiple analyses into a unified report that clearly conveys conclusion(s) to the question(s) posed at project start.
