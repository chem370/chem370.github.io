- A technical report detailing the entire project, to be turned in in stages (one per group).
- Consult the [schedule]({{site.url}}/course-information/schedule) to keep track of due dates for notebooks and report stages.  
- Refer to the materials on the [writing page]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports) for templates, formatting guidelines, content expectations, and grading rubrics.
