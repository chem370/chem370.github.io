## Instrument Procedure

1.  Use the CHEM370 user on the FTIR.  Make sure you are collecting spectra as *Absorbance* vs. *Wavenumber*.
1.  Record a background spectrum on the FT-IR according to the FT-IR SOP.

## Sampling Procedure

1.  Place 1 drop the sample on the ATR window and acquire a spectrum. You do not need the anvil for liquid samples.
2.  Wet a Kimwipe with a small amount of acetone and clean the ATR cell with it.
3.  Repeat the above steps 2 more times, for a total of three spectra for your sample.
4.  Repeat the above steps for each sample, so you end up with three spectra of each sample.
1.  You will need your data in CSV format.  The Spectrum One does this automatically.  Just copy the exported data from the "CHEM370 Folder" (there is a shortcut on the desktop) to your folder on NEON.
4.  Make sure you leave the instrument and your work area clean (see Cleanup, below), and log out of the computer.

## Waste Disposal and Cleanup

- Clean the IR with methanol and replace the cover.

   <div class = "warning">
   Never spray solvent directly on the IR -- always spray it on a Kimwipe pointed away from the instrument.

- Wipe up any e-cigarette liquid on and around the IR with methanol.
- Make sure your work area and the instrument are cleaner than you found them.
